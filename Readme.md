## Behind the scenes

### Student app

We need this for writing our authentication views as well as student & department models. Student model has the first+last name ,department foreignkey and studentID which is one-to-one field to Django' User model. We use Django's User Model for authentication . There will be 3 views: login,signup and logout. The urls will have `/student/< login or signup or logout >/`.

### Library app

This is our main app where we will write our library system's main logic. It comprises of 4 models:

- **Author** - for storing name & description of author
- **Book** - for storing name , image ,category of a book & connecting to the author
- **Issue** - for tracking each & every issue a student requests. It will also track the book for which issue is requested , issue status (whether issued or not) , return status (whether returned or not) , return date (last date to return the book) and more...
